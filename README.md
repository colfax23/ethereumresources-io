# Ethereum Resources

I decided to turn my long-curated list of bookmarks about Ethereum into a website!  If they are helpful to me, I imagine they'd be helpful to others.

If you see something that's a mistake or if you'd like to recommend an addition, please send over a PR or Issue!

## Developing Locally

This is a Next.js project.  To get up and running, clone this repo and:

1) `yarn install`
2) `yarn run dev` -> this will continually compile and deploy your website locally
3) View your changes on http://localhost:3000/
